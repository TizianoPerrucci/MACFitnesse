You can find the MAC application here https://github.com/TizianoPerrucci/MorningAfterCheck , after all is a simple Scalatra application that implements the simple functional
requirements used for a DSL exercise.

Moreover there is an additional branch (time) that show the DSL grammar extended to accept optionally the time information.
